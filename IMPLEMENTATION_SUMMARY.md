# PVS to SVRF Converter Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Code Implementation**
   - Implemented rcsPvrs2Svrf.h with appropriate class structure
   - Implemented rcsPvrs2Svrf.cpp with parser-based conversion approach
   - Integrated with existing lexical and syntax parsing infrastructure

2. **Documentation**
   - Created pvs2svrf.readme with detailed usage instructions
   - Added examples of PVS-to-SVRF conversion patterns
   - Documented limitations and implementation details

3. **Testing**
   - Created test_pvs2svrf.sh for Unix/Linux testing
   - Created test_pvs2svrf.ps1 for PowerShell testing
   - Created test_pvs2svrf.bat for Windows batch testing
   - Created sample PVS files for testing conversion

## Implementation Architecture

The implementation follows a parser-based approach:
1. **Tokenization**: Uses the existing lexical analyzer to tokenize PVS files
2. **Parsing**: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens
3. **Code Generation**: Traverses the AST to generate equivalent SVRF code

This approach provides several advantages over regex-based conversion:
- More robust handling of complex syntax
- Better error reporting
- Easier maintenance
- Better preservation of code structure

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Rule Handling**
   - Implement more sophisticated rule conversion
   - Handle complex via definitions
   - Support multi-layer operations

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test with complex real-world PVS files
   - Compare output with manually converted SVRF
   - Address any edge cases

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the conversion process
   - Optimize memory usage for large files
   - Improve error handling

4. **User Interface**
   - Add GUI support for PVS to SVRF conversion
   - Enhance error reporting and user feedback

## Usage Notes

To use the PVS-to-SVRF converter:

1. Command line:
   ```
   pvconverter -pvs2svrf -i input.pvs -o output.svrf
   ```

2. Test script (Windows):
   ```
   .\test_pvs2svrf.ps1
   ```
   or
   ```
   test_pvs2svrf.bat
   ```

3. Test script (Linux):
   ```
   ./test_pvs2svrf.sh
   ```
